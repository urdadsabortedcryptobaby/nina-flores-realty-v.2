            One of the most common questions sellers ask is: <em>&ldquo;How much is my home actually worth?&rdquo;</em> The
            answer depends on far more than what you paid for it — and getting it right can mean the difference between a
            quick, profitable sale and a listing that sits on the market for months.

          <Section title="How Real Estate Agents Price Homes">
            <p>
              A licensed agent uses a <strong>Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)</strong> to determine your home&apos;s
              value. This is an in-depth look at recently sold homes in your area that are similar to yours in size,
              condition, age, and features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key factors an agent weighs during a CMA:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Recent comparable sales ("comps")</strong> — homes sold nearby in the last 3–6 months</li>
              <li><strong>Active listings</strong> — your competition on the market right now</li>
              <li><strong>Expired listings</strong> — homes that did not sell, often because they were overpriced</li>
              <li><strong>Location specifics</strong> — school districts, lot size, views, noise, proximity to amenities</li>
              <li><strong>Condition and upgrades</strong> — renovated kitchens and baths, new roofs, curb appeal</li>
              <li><strong>Market trend</strong> — is inventory rising or falling? Are buyers or sellers in control?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A CMA is <em>not</em> a formal appraisal, but it gives you a realistic, data-backed price range before
              you ever list. Done well, it positions your home to attract the right buyers quickly.
            </p>

          {/* Section 2 */}
          <Section title="Why You Should Hire an Agent to Price Your Home">
            <p>
              Online estimators (Zillow&apos;s Zestimate, Redfin Estimate, etc.) are a starting point — not a strategy.
              They pull broad public data and have no knowledge of your home&apos;s interior condition, your neighbor&apos;s
              recent renovation, or the micro-market dynamics that a local expert sees every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is why professional pricing matters:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Overpricing costs you money.</strong> Homes that sit on the market develop a stigma. Buyers
                start to wonder what is wrong, and you often end up accepting less than if you had priced correctly
                from day one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Underpricing leaves equity on the table.</strong> A good agent helps you capture every dollar
                the market will support — and in a competitive situation, that means knowing when to expect and handle
                multiple offers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pricing strategy is not just a number.</strong> It includes how you position the home online,
                what photography and marketing strategy you use, and how you respond to early market feedback.
              </li>
            </ul>

          <Section title="When Do You Need a Licensed Appraiser?">
            <p>
              A real estate agent&apos;s CMA is ideal for listing strategy. But there are situations where you need a
              <strong> licensed appraiser</strong> — a neutral, state-certified professional whose written opinion of
              value carries legal and financial weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may need an appraiser when:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You are <strong>refinancing</strong> — most lenders require a formal appraisal to validate the new loan amount</li>
              <li>You are <strong>settling an estate</strong> and need an official value for probate or tax purposes</li>
              <li>You are going through a <strong>divorce</strong> and need a neutral valuation accepted by the court</li>
              <li>You are <strong>disputing your property taxes</strong> and need documented evidence of value</li>
              <li>You want a <strong>pre-listing appraisal</strong> to price your home with maximum credibility</li>
              <li>Your buyer&apos;s lender <strong>requires an independent appraisal</strong> as part of the mortgage process</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              An appraiser charges a fee (typically $300–$600 in the Tucson market) and provides a formal written
              report. Their valuation is independent and unbiased by the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not sure whether you need an agent&apos;s CMA, an appraisal, or both? Nina can help you think through
              your situation before you spend a dollar.

          <Section title="Quick Tips Before You List">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Get a CMA first.</strong> Even if you ultimately hire an appraiser, the agent&apos;s CMA helps
                you understand current buyer demand and competitive positioning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Do a pre-listing walkthrough.</strong> Small repairs and staging updates can meaningfully
                increase your final sale price.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trust the data, not sentiment.</strong> Your home has memories and meaning — but buyers are
                comparing it to every other active listing in the price range.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Review the market trend.</strong> A rising market may support pricing at the top of your
                range; a cooling market may call for more aggressive positioning.
